            <h2>A bear with a small brain</h2>
            <p>Winnie the Pooh was one of my favourite Disney characters growing up so this page will be dedicated to
                him.</p>
            <p>Winnie-the-Pooh first appeared by name in a children's story commissioned by London's Evening News for
                Christmas Eve 1925. The character is inspired by a stuffed toy that Milne had bought for his son
                Christopher Robin in Harrods department store, and a bear they had viewed at London Zoo. </p>
