                <p>Winnie the Pooh was one of my favourite Disney characters growing up.</p>
                <p>Winnie-the-Pooh first appeared by name in a children's story commissioned by London's Evening News
                    for
                    Christmas Eve 1925. The character is inspired by a stuffed toy that Milne had bought for his son
                    Christopher Robin in Harrods department store, and a bear they had viewed at London Zoo. </p>
                <p>In the Milne books, Pooh is naive and slow-witted, but he is also friendly, thoughtful, and
                    steadfast.
                    Although he and his friends agree that he is "a bear of very little brain", Pooh is occasionally
                    acknowledged to have a clever idea,
                    usually driven by common sense. These include riding in Christopher Robin's umbrella to rescue
                    Piglet
                    from a flood, discovering "the North Pole" by
                    picking it up to help fish Roo out of the river, inventing the game of Poohsticks, and getting
                    Eeyore
                    out of the river by dropping a large rock on one side of him to wash him towards the bank.
